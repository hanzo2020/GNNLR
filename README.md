# GNNLR
This is the code file for the research paper Neural-Symbolic Recommendation Model with
Graph-Enhanced Information.

## Example to run the codes
```
> cd \src  
> sh GNNLR.sh  
```
Two datasets are currently available: GiftCard and Luxury.  
When you need to change the dataset, modify the dataset parameter in the .sh file and also modify the parameter self.dataset in 'models/GNNLR.py'.  

More details of the dataset and runs will be provided after the paper is accepted!
